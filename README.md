Chronic Disease Analysis Project

In this project, I conducted an analysis of chronic disease data from the CDC, focusing on diabetes prevalence across U.S. states and territories, stratified by demographic factors such as age and race/ethnicity. Using Python, I cleaned, transformed, and visualized the data to uncover trends and insights.

Key components of the project:

Data Cleaning & Preparation: Removed unnecessary columns and handled missing data to ensure the accuracy of the dataset. Unrealistic outliers (such as data points with over 100% prevalence) were filtered out.
Data Analysis: Analyzed diabetes prevalence across different demographic groups, particularly focusing on age and race/ethnicity, to explore the impact of these factors on disease prevalence.
Visualization: Created detailed visualizations using Matplotlib to compare diabetes rates by state, age group, and race/ethnicity. Custom color schemes were applied to enhance clarity and emphasize key insights.
Version Control with Git: Managed the project using Git and GitHub, ensuring version control, proper documentation, and code organization.

Tools Used:

Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy)
Git/GitHub for version control
Jupyter Notebooks for data exploration and visualization

This project demonstrates my ability to work with health-related datasets, clean and analyze data, and produce meaningful visual insights, which are essential skills in health data research and analytics.

Acknowledgments: Mention that the dataset is publicly available from U.S. health agencies.
